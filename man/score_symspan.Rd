\title{Calculate SymSpan scores from a messy raw dataframe}
\usage{
score_symspan(x, blocks = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{dataframe (an imported .emrge file)}

\item{blocks}{number of blocks administered. From 1-3}
}
\description{
This function skips the 'raw_symspan()' step and therefore
    is not advised. However, some researchers may find
    it easier to just skip right to 'score_symspan()'
}
